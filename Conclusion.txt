Conclusion and Discussion:
Using the given python script for our project, we were able to calculate different indices which evaluates the accuracy of the given two maps. Before giving explanation for the results we obtained in the previous two tables, it’s better to introduce the indices mentioned above to better understand the assessment process.
-	UA (User’s Accuracy):
The User's Accuracy is the accuracy from the point of view of a map user, not the map maker. the User's accuracy essentially tells us how often the class on the map will actually be present on the ground. This is referred to as reliability.

-	PA (Producer’s Accuracy):
Producer's Accuracy is the map accuracy from the point of view of the map maker (the producer). This is how often are real features on the ground correctly shown on the classified map or the probability that a certain land cover of an area on the ground is classified as such.

-	OA (Overall Accuracy):
Overall Accuracy is essentially tells us out of all of the reference sites what proportion were mapped correctly. The overall accuracy is usually expressed as a percent, with 100% accuracy being a perfect classification where all reference site were classified correctly. Overall accuracy is the easiest to calculate and understand but ultimately only provides the map user and producer with basic accuracy information.

As we see, these indices defines the concept of accuracy from different aspects, each one of them represents a unique point of view, but after all they are all following the same theme of assessment.
Getting into details, the GHS thematic map showed that 359 out of our 6oo hundred points represent non-populated areas, and the other 241 represent populated area. 
For the Worldpop data, the thematic map recorded 355 non-populated areas, and 245 populated ones. 
But what we really have in reality based on our reference data (satellite images), the satellite reference maps recorded 527 non-populated areas, and 73 populated area. 
According to this significant difference, the GHS data has an overall accuracy of 0.57, where the worldpop data has overall accuracy of 0.67.
Despite the fact that these accuracies are not reasonably representative of what we have in reality, the worldpop data has more accuracy than the data comes from the GHS, which gives the advantage for worldpop data in this intercomparison.
After obtaining the results, several questions came into our mind, the main one was where such errors and uncertainties would come from?
We tried to think about some acceptable answers taking into consideration our area of interest, the two data sources, and even our effort, and this is what we got.
-	Taking into considerations that the majority of our area of interest covers Africa, we were not that surprised. Getting these results would be much more controversial if we are dealing with continents like Europe, but since we know how things are going in Africa –socially, politically and economically-, the result were kind of acceptable.
-	The differences between the two data sets given from the two maps could be easily explained by the methodologies adopted by the two different bodies, but when comparing them what we have in the field we believe that a little improvement in their adopted work methodologies can give more accurate results, however, since we have no information about the standards the follow to collect their data, we believe that this is not something we can discuss in details.  
-	Despite the fact that the Base maps used in this project are reliable and trust-worthy since we are talking about Google and Bing, we are not sure about any uncertainties which can be caused by those maps in our situation, are we sure that the base maps and the thematic ones belong to the same time period?, what if the satellite images are not clear enough to visualize the population presence somewhere?
-	As a group of this project, we tried our best to keep our focusing at its highest level, but we can’t deny that some personal errors can still happen.
